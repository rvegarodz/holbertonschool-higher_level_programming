# Holberton School Higher Level Programming - JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains JavaScript code for working with objects, scopes, and closures as part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum at Holberton School.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

### [0-rectangle.js](./0-rectangle.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines an empty `Rectangle` class.

### [1-rectangle.js](./1-rectangle.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a `Rectangle` class with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes.

### [2-rectangle.js](./2-rectangle.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a `Rectangle` class with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes, and methods to calculate the area and perimeter.

### [3-rectangle.js](./3-rectangle.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a `Rectangle` class with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes, and methods to calculate the area and perimeter. It also adds a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the object.

### [4-rectangle.js](./4-rectangle.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a `Rectangle` class with a constructor that initializes width and height attributes, and methods to calculate the area and perimeter. It also adds a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the object, and adds setters for width and height that validate input.

### [5-square.js](./5-square.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class.

### [6-square.js](./6-square.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class, and overrides the setters for width and height to keep the sides of the square equal.

### [7-read_write.js](./7-read_write.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that reads and writes a file using `fs` module.

### [8-create_file.js](./8-create_file.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that creates a file using `fs` module.

### [9-modified_by.js](./9-modified_by.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a function that returns a new function that increments a value by a given step.

### [10-object.js](./10-object.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that modifies the `increment` function in `9-modified_by.js` to apply it to an object property.

### [100-let_me_const.js](./100-let_me_const.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that modifies the value of a constant variable defined in another module.

### [101-call_me_moby.js](./101-call_me_moby.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that defines a function that calls another function a given number of times.

### [102-histogram.js](./102-histogram.js)

This file contains a JavaScript script that computes a histogram of a list of integers.
